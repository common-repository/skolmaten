== Description ==

Skolmaten.se is a service where schools can handle their lunch menu so students, and hungry teachers too, can get information about today's lunch, and the next couple of weeks too. 
This plugin uses information from that service and displays it on your wordpress site using widget and/or shortcodes.

Your school have to have be registered at skolmaten.se for this plugin to be useful. To use their service you can visit them here: http://skolmaten.se/

Snillrik is not connected to Skolmaten.se, this is simply a plugin using their brilliant service and API/Feed.

3. Visit the settings page and set the fields to your school and preferenses. 
4. Use the widget or the shortcodes to add menues to your site. (as described on the settingspage)
